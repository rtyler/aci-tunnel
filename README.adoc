= ACI Tunnel

This repository allows for the creation of public facing tunnels to local
services through
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/[Azure
Container Instances]. This makes it easy to share in-progress development work
with colleagues across multiple networks and continentns!


== Usage

The `aci-tunnel` script expects that the
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI]
is installed and configured for your Azure account.

After that has been set up, simply invoke `aci-tunnel` with the ports you wish to tunnel:

[source,bash]
----
aci-tunnel 8080
----


Once the tunnel is active, you would be able to use the public IP address
printed on the screen!
